## Project status

This project is still in progress and is missing some important functions. It can therefor not be run yet. 


## Contributing

This is one of my first projects and meant as a learning process. For that reason I would like to develop the different functionalities myself first and welcome feedback about my decisions and code.


## Acknowledgments

Thanks go to Flo Ueckermann for general tips and help with setting up a python webserver.

This project wouldn't be made without the existence of the stackoverflow community and free tutorials such as [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5wysXqaIV8&feature=youtu.be).
