# movie-list-generator

This program makes a data base from all locally stored movies with information collected from [The Movie DB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and creates random selections of movies. <br>
For collective movie watching, every viewer can set a veto against one movie until one movie remains: the one that will be watched. 
<br><br>Procedurally written in Python using a sqlite database. <br> The programm will be run in a webbrowser on a flask server.  

## Project status

This project still has bugs, mostly within the JavaScript functions. <br>


## Contributing

This is one of my first projects and meant as a learning process. For that reason I would like to develop the different functionalities myself first and welcome feedback about my decisions and code.


## Acknowledgments

Thanks go to Flo Ueckermann for general tips and help with setting up a python webserver.

This project wouldn't be made without the existence of the stackoverflow community and free tutorials such as [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5wysXqaIV8&feature=youtu.be), [Bert Carremans](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scrape-the-web-for-top-rated-movies-on-tv/) on freecodecamp or [Prashanth Xavier](https://medium.com/quick-code/absolute-beginners-guide-to-slaying-apis-using-python-7b380dc82236) on Medium Quick Code.
